# PROJECT SUMMARY #

## LavaLab: Simply Epic ###

### TECHNICAL ###
LavaLab is a repository for a Unity project, developed in C#.  

### GAMEPLAY SUMMARY ###
For the gameplay summary, check out the doc in Google Drive (which I might just upload).  
The one problem with uploading is the fact that there is an image in the doc which is extremely useful for understanding how the code will work.  

### What is this repository for? ###
This repository is used as a great way to keep track of code changes, new ideas, and revert unnecessary "updates, all with the power of Git.  The code is powered mainly by SmartGit, a great GUI for Windows, Mac, and (Thankfully) Linux.  

### How do I get set up? ###
When starting the project for the first time, it may take a while to open.  This is due to Unity having to generate new Library and Temp folders, as well as MonoDevelop generating new .sln builds.  This is not necessary for the final product, so .gitignore ignores any new additions.
